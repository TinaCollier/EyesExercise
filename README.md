# Eyes Exercise

## What Is It?
For this exercise, we had to create a second eye and make both eyes follow the cursor. Run the program by dragging eyes.html into your browser. Move your mouse around and the eyes will track the movement.

## What I Would Do Differently Next Time
I would put the eyes on a face and make the face move dynamically as well.
